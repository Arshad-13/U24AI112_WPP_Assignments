# The Utopian tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. The first growth cycle occurs during the
# monsoon, when it doubles in height. The second growth cycle occurs during the summer, when its height
# increases by 1 meter.
# Now, a new Utopian tree sapling is planted at the onset of the monsoon. Its height is 1 meter. Can you find
# the height of the tree after N growth cycles?
# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
# T lines follow. Each line contains an integer, N, that denotes the number of cycles for that test case.
# Constraints
# 1 <= T <= 10
# 0 <= N <= 60
# Output Format
# For each test case, print the height of the Utopian tree after N cycles.

# Explanation #00:
# There are 2 test cases. When N=0, the height of the tree remains unchanged. When N = 1, the tree doubles
# its height as it’s planted just before the onset of monsoon.
# Explanation #01:
# There are 2 test cases.
# When N=0,
# The height of the tree at the end of the 1st cycle = 2
# The height of the tree at the end of the 2nd cycle = 3
# The height of the tree at the end of the 3rd cycle = 6
# When N = 1,
# The height of the tree at the end of the 1st cycle = 2
# The height of the tree at the end of the 2nd cycle = 3
# The height of the tree at the end of the 3rd cycle = 6
# the height of the tree at the end of the 4th cycle = 7
